#Aura
---
Aura is a Action Platformer with Mana mechanics. Aura right now is in it's alpha stages, and will have a release to come out soon. It is also a project for the teams Animeme and Void Inc. in Sno-Isle Tech's Video Game Design class. I, Nire Inicana, will be maintaining the Github repo even after the project is done with. Once there is a stable version of the Void Engine, which is linked under [Game Details](#Game Details), I will post a version of this game that is ready to play on this repository's releases page.

Aura takes place in a magical land, that is yet to be named, where a wizard lives in a house in the middle of a region named "The Plains", since of course in this land there is only one area that has the biome type, plains. The wizard leaves his home to go to the nearby village, where he finds that the village was abandoned and that there is baddies everywhere! So he goes into a forest where there is a cave. Once in the cave he has to go over many obsticals and finnally at the end of his journey he finds a boss! The boss had taken all of the people from the village and killed them. The wizard must beat the boss to free the people.
